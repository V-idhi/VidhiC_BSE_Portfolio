# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was creating a circuit using the ESP devkit v1, an LED, resistors,a breadboard, a button, and some wires. With the help of Arduino I was able to create an LED that lights up when a button is pressed. I learned how a breadboard works and how to connect wires to different pins.
