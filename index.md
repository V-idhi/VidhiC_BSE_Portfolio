# IoT Weather Indicator
 My project is weather Indicator that tells me the weather in my area.

Reflection:
I learned a lot during my project and in Bluestamp, and even though I went through many complications and problems, but I still had so much fun. I learned how to use Arduino, solder, and so much more. My project, in the end, didn't turn out exactly as I had hoped, but I was still able to make a lot of progress and gain new ideas and thought processes. Overall, even though my project wasn't a full success, I think that my learning was.

# Final Milestone

My Final milestone was creating a circuit using an ESP devkit v1, an LED, resistors, a breadboard, IFTTT, and Adafruit. With the help of Arduino, IFTTT, and Adafruit, I was able to create an LED that lights based off of the weather. I used IFTTT and Adafruit to pull weather data and connected those platforms to my auduino so that an orangle LED lights up when the sky is clear, a green LED lights up when the sky is cloudy, and a blue LED lights up when it rains.

# Second Milestone

My Second milestone was creating a circuit using an ESP devkit v1, an LED, resistors, a breadboard, and Adafruit. With the help of Arduino and Adafruit, I was able to create an LED that lights up when a button is turned on. This milestone is pretty similar to my previous one, but instead of the button being on the circuit with the help of Adafruit, I was able to turn my LED on digitally.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was creating a circuit using the ESP devkit v1, an LED, resistors,a breadboard, a button, and some wires. With the help of Arduino I was able to create an LED that lights up when a button is pressed. I learned how a breadboard works and how to connect wires to different pins.
