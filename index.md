# IoT Weather Indicator
 My project is weather Indicator that tells me the weather when the device is unlocked. This Indicator also plays music when unlocked.

# Second Milestone

My Second milestone was creating a circuit using an ESP devkit v1, an LED, resistors, a breadboard, and Adafruit. With the help of Arduino and Adafruit, I was able to create an LED that lights up when a button is turned on. This milestone is pretty similar to my previous one, but instead of the button being on the circuit with the help of Adafruit, I was able to turn my LED on digitally.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was creating a circuit using the ESP devkit v1, an LED, resistors,a breadboard, a button, and some wires. With the help of Arduino I was able to create an LED that lights up when a button is pressed. I learned how a breadboard works and how to connect wires to different pins.
